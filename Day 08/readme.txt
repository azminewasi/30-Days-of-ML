💡 What You’ll Learn
In Lesson 1 (How Models Work), you will start at the very beginning: what exactly is “machine learning”, and how is it used in the real world? You’ll learn the answers to these questions and explore the basics of decision trees, as you start to build a strong foundation for some of the most cutting-edge techniques in data science.

In Lesson 2 (Basic Data Exploration), you’ll learn all about pandas, the primary tool used by data scientists for exploring and manipulating data. Then, you’ll use your new knowledge to examine a dataset of home prices.
